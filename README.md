# sudokuSolver
A bit better sudoku solver (that the basic backtracker)
Basically - this is improved backtracking-sudoku-solver algorithm, which uses "projections" to decrease number of possible input values for cells. 
I've managed to decrease time on some grids from ~1200 seconds (using bare backtracking method) to ~20-300 seconds per grid.
