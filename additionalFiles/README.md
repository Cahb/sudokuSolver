These are additional files you'll need to get the app working.

Basically, if you want to start everything anew - create empty files with these names, and proceed to download \ solve sudoku-grids.

P.S. 

SDKS.dat file is for storing pure "sudoku-strings" retrieved from the site.

SkippedSdk.sdk is a file where information of the skipped sudoku-grids is stored.

tempSdk2.txt is a file where solved sudokus are stored.
